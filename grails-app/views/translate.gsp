	    <h3>How to translate</h3>
	    <ol id="translation-guide">
	        <li><a href="https://translations.launchpad.net/whyteboard/+login">Create a Launchpad account</a>. This allows you to receive credit in the translators list.</li>
	        <img src="images/translate/register.png" alt="Register at Launchpad" title="Register at Launchpad" />
	            
	        <li><a href="https://translations.launchpad.net/+editmylanguages">Set your preferred languages</a>. You can then translate Whyteboard into these languages</li>
	        <img src="images/translate/preferred-languages.png" alt="Your preferred translation languages" title="Your preferred translation languages" />
	        
	        <li>Go to <a href="https://translations.launchpad.net/whyteboard">Whyteboard Translations at Launchpad</a> and click the language you intend to help with. Your preferred languages are displayed initially, but you can view all languages and translate that.</li>

	        <li>The translation interface is shown - each English message with a corresponding box to type the translation. As you can see, Launchpad will offer suggestions if the English message has been used in other software.</li>

	        <li>When translating, keep codes such as <code>%s</code>, <code>%i</code> and <code>%d</code> intact - these have special meaning in the program.</li>
	        <li>The &amp; symbols you see, e.g. <code>&amp;File</code> and <code>&amp;Edit</code> are used as <abbr title="Allows you to select the menu with alt+the letter after the &amp;">Keyboard Access</abbr> keys.</li>
	        <li>Try to Capitalize Menu Items and to use good grammar throughout.</li>
	        <li>Your contribution will be added to the next release of Whyteboard and your name added to the credits!</li>
