			<ol id="translate-guide">
				<li>Register at <a href="https://launchpad.net/+login">Launchpad.net</a> and set your preferred language.</li>
				<li>Go to <a href="https://translations.launchpad.net/whyteboard">Whyteboard Translations at Launchpad</a> and click the language you intend to help with. If you don't see your language, then you have not set your preferred language.</li>
				<li>Keep codes such as <code>%s</code>, <code>%i</code>, <code>%d</code> intact. - these represent variables such as "%i days" - this is expanded to "3 days"</li>
				<li>The &amp; symbols you see, e.g. &nbsp; <code>&amp;File</code> and <code>&amp;Edit</code> are used as <acronym title="Allows you to select the menu with alt+the letter after the &amp;">Keyboard Access</acronym> keys.</li>
				<li>Try to Capitalize Menu Items and to use good grammar throughout.</li>
